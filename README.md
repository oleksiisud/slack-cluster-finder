# 🖥️ Stellar Search DS Project

Slack is a widely used application, but its search and message filtering are very limited. Because it’s keyword-based, it often misses context, making it frustrating for users to find what they’re looking for.

**Stellar Search** fixes this problem by delivering insights from your chat logs through context clustering.
